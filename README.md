## About the Project and Future Improvements

This project was made as part of the CodeClan course. I had a great time building it and learn alot about what it takes to build a full-stack App from the ground up. It was my first full-stack app.

I plan to come back to it sometimes soon in order to improve it. Objectives for the next sprint:
    1. Refactor.
    2. Allow users to upload photos locally which are then available to the app. (At present they are only available on Heroku if they were included in the build)
    3. Improve the time-table functionallity. 
    4. Redesign the Interfaces to make them more inline with UI principles.
